Financial results table: This includes revenue, revenue growth%, gross profit, gross profit margin%, EBITDA, EBITDA margin%, operating cash flow, taxes paid, net working capital, capex, other investing cash flow, CFADS, financing cash flow and its components (e.g. debt issuance, debt repayment etc.),  Change in cash and cash equivalents, opening cash, closing cash, total debt (short term and long term external borrowings), net debt, and leverage (net debt/EBITDA) 

Financial commentary: This is based on the financial results but are in the form of bullet points commenting on the changes over the past three years. This includes increase/decrease in revenues, profitability (EBITDA) and debt. Please do mention the reasoning behind the changes too. Other than these, try commenting on net working capital as well as capex, and any metric which has varied a lot in any of the year and their reasoning. We always want to understand the reasoning. In addition, provide maybe a bullet point on the outlook from any credit rating agency if available in their latest credit rating report. 

Format should be in the form of bullet points e.g. - During FY24 volume decreased 6.1% y-o-y to 39.5m units, reflecting customers’ inventory optimization strategies, longer than expected customer plant stoppages, and slower than expected shift toward e-mobility. - Revenues decreased 1.7% to $4.9b, as re-pricing and underutilized capacity commercial negotiations partially offset volume decline EBITDA increased by 9.4%, however, to $633m, on the back of cost-optimization measures, customer negotiations and the depreciation of the Mexican peso - In FY23, the incremental debt responded to transitory needs, derived from higher working capital and the setup of the three new facilities for the EV/SC segment - Moody's stable outlook reflects expectations of continued cost-cutting, deleveraging, and prudent liquidity management to support improving credit metrics through FY25

This section is divided into two sub-sections. The first sub-section is a table with capital structure of the latest year. The second sub-section is commentary on capital structure 

Capital structure table: This includes breakdown of secured and unsecured debt facilities such as term loans, RCF, bonds and lease liabilities, among other types. For each facility, maturity (in the format e.g. Jun-27 for June 2027), interest rate and amount outstanding is provided. This table is used to calculate total debt, gross external debt, net external debt and liquidity (cash + undrawn committed debt facilities) 

Capital structure commentary: This is commentary on particular debt facilities mentioned in the table. Commentary should not be generic but must mention all or some of the topics including debt covenants (what they are), security (what assets are secured against debts), liquidity (any undrawn facilities available in addition to the cash), any recent refinancings.  

Format should be in the form of bullet points e.g. - As of Dec-24, the Company is in compliance with all obligations and affirmative and negative covenants - There are no assets pledged as collateral for any of the subsidiaries, except for some assets, pledged as collateral in a long-term debt granted by BNDES. As of Dec-24, the value of the pledged assets is $253,000 - The Company has uncommitted short-term credit lines unused of more than $688.1m, while it has committed medium-term credit lines available of $402.7m 

Source: Please utilize the financial statements/annual reports for this section, as well as web search if required. Usually financial statements/annual reports have a section of debt/creditors/borrowings with such information 

Please avoid internal debt information. These include loans from parent company, or group companies

-- Depleting Liquidity

-- Refinancing Risks
-- Falling Profitability
-- Restructuring
-- Imminent/Concentrated Maturities
-- Large Customer or Supplier Concentration (e.g., >30–40% revenue from one customer) — revenue / supply shock risk
-- Collateral Shortfall or Weak Security Package — unsecured creditors at risk
-- Rising Interest Rates / Mark-to-Market Funding Costs — higher service costs and covenant pressure
-- Negative or Volatile Cash Flows / CFADS Decline — impaired debt service capability
-- Material Asset Impairments or Write-downs — equity wipeout and covenant impacts
-- Major Capex Overruns or Aggressive Capital Spending — cash drains and margin compression
-- Supply-Chain Disruption or Single-source Suppliers — operational continuity risk
-- Credit Rating Downgrade or Watchlist Placement — access to markets constrained, higher funding costs
-- Cross-default or Intercompany Guarantees — contagion across facilities / group entities
-- Mass Layoffs / Key Management Turnover — signalling distress and execution risk
-- Fraud, Governance Failures or Related-party Transactions — heightened legal/contractual risk
