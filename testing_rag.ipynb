      "- Radley + Co. Limited operates in the retail sector and is exposed to the retail markets in the U.K. and the U.S.A., where consumer disposable income dynamics are an important driver of trading performance. \n",
      "- The company’s trading plan assumes no like-for-like growth but incorporates moderate growth from opening new sales channels, with management noting the recovery of some one-off operational disruptions from the prior year. \n",
      "- It manages key financial risks arising from exchange rates, credit and liquidity through a risk management programme that monitors currency exposure and related finance costs, and it uses forward currency contracts when necessary. \n",
      "- The company’s customers are end consumers whose demand is sensitive to cost of living pressures, including higher food, fuel and interest costs that weigh on disposable income. \n",
      "- The company is facing financial stress with Group turnover declining to £72.0m in FY24, EBITDA before non-recurring items decreasing to £2.7m and net debt increasing to £10.8m, alongside an FY24 operating loss of £0.5m, and the Directors flagged a material uncertainty over going concern given that debt covenants could be breached in a downside case and additional financing may be required. \n",

      "- Revenue declined by 6.9% in FY24 to £72.0m from £77.3m as cost-of-living pressures weighed on UK consumer spend and international demand softened in EMEA and Asia Pacific, partially offset by modest growth in North America; UK revenue fell to £52.8m (from £56.0m), EMEA notably contracted to £0.5m (from £2.3m), Asia Pacific decreased to £2.1m (from £2.9m), while North America increased to £16.6m (from £16.0m)\n",
      "- EBITDA decreased to £2.7m in FY24 from £4.3m in FY23, reflecting the lower revenue base and a tougher trading environment with inflationary pressures on consumers and input costs that reduced operating efficiency despite ongoing cost controls\n",
      "- EBITDA margin compressed to 3.7% in FY24 from 5.6% in FY23 as top-line pressure and a less favorable regional mix weighed on operating profitability\n",
      "- Net debt (excluding shareholder loans and preference shares) increased to £10.8m in FY24 from £8.0m in FY23 as weaker earnings reduced deleveraging capacity; leverage therefore rose to 4.1x in FY24 from 1.9x in FY23, driven primarily by the decline in EBITDA\n",
      "- Cash balances increased modestly in FY23 to £1.6m from £1.4m, though FY24 cash movement is not disclosed in the extracts; the FY23 cash increase was small relative to net debt, highlighting limited free cash generation in the period\n",
